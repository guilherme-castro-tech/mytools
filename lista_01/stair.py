    We wanna develop an algorithm such that given a stair with n steps
    calculate how many ways a person could get on top if the person 
    may go up 1 or 2 steps. Basically find all sollutions of n = j.1 +k.2
    for j and k given n. 
    We can see j = n-2k
    For j >= 0 : n>=2k or k = {0,1,2,...,floor(n/2)} 
    in this way the number of sulutions is  floor(n/2) + 1
    '''
    number_solution = floor(n/2)+1
    '''
    However, this method gives the number of solutions, we don't want
    just the number of solutions, we also want their combinations
    for each pair (j,k) the combinations of j+k getting k elements gives 
    our final answer
